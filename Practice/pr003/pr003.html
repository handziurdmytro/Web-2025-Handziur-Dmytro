    <p id="paragraph">The Abstract Factory Pattern is a way of organizing how
        you create groups of things that are related to each other.
        It provides a set of rules or instructions that let you create
        different types of things without knowing exactly what those things are.
        This helps you keep everything organized and lets you switch between different
        types easily.

        Abstract Factory pattern is almost same as Factory Pattern and is considered as another layer of abstraction over factory pattern.
        Abstract Factory patterns work around a super-factory which creates other factories.
        At runtime, the abstract factory is coupled with any desired concrete factory which can create objects of the desired type.
